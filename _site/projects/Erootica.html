  For Global Game Jam 2023, the theme was: "Growth". Naturally, I joined a team of students to make a Flower Dating Simulator. <br> 
  The game combined elements of farming and typical visual novel dialogue, where you play as a gardener taking care of sentient flowers. Our team leader advocated for us to use Godot to develop the game, which was a challenge for us. <br>

   My role on the team was the writer. We needed a lot of dialogue for the game, so I wrote about 6000 words of dialogue over 2 days, for 4 flowers with different personalities.  <br>
   I dipped my toes into Godot as well, but my main focus was on the writing.<br>
