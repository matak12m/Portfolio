  Our 3D digital art project for our second semester of our second year was to worldbuild an alien planet, and create assets that fit into that world.  <br>
  I thought of a world based on an ice planet, where life still exists deep the ice, but only sparingly. I imagined a hardy species that can survive in any climate, that is trying to colonize the planet, living on the surface, and discovering the life underwater. <br>

  We created concept art, as well as 3D models. I used Maya 2023 for the 3D modelling and Photoshop for concepts. We used a variety of Mayas tools to create models, a terrain sculpt, and flesh out our world.
