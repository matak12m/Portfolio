   This was my second year first semester project. Our goal was to make a game inside a webpage with a theme of time travel.<br>
    I chose to make a time-based puzzle, where you try to align schedules of your friends to meet up at the campfire at the same time. You can physically rotate the clock next to the game screen to change the time, and you can affect your friends schedules by interacting with the environment. <br>
     The game is technically finished, however, I plan on adding some quality of life features so that the game can be played without a personal explanation.

       I am currently working on a more polished version, so this is a WIP! <br> <br>
        This is purely a programming project for me, as all the assets are borrowed from royalty free sources. <p>
          You can play the current version of the game <a href ="https://matak12m.github.io/on-the-clock/"><button class = "textButton" >here!</button></a>
