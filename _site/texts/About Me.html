    Im a Czech student currently living in Ireland. I've always been fascinated by games. I've been making my own board games with cardboard scraps since I was a kid, but none of them really became popular outside my family. I also always loved art as a form of expression. <br> <br>
 When I was choosing a college to go to, I decided to go on my own path into a Games Development course in a whole different country, following that childhood hobby, as well as my interest in programming. I switched courses in my second year to Interactive Digital Arts and Design, to diversify my skillset apart from just programming, and found out that I really enjoy designing, both games and websites! <br>
  The course is full of learning with many different programs like Photoshop, Maya, Spine, Aseprite, or just regular od HTML and CSS.   <br> <br>
   In my spare time I run the college's board game society, or I run, literally. I also like cooking and hiking, and I'm a huge indie game nerd. <br> <br>
   But enough about me, and more about my work."
