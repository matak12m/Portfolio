             As a group rpject for Web User Interface Design, our goal was to design and develop an educational website, similar to W3Schools or Khan Academy. We created it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br> The project had 5 stages: Research and Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Presentation. <br> My input was focused on the research and design part of the process, Where I took into account trends among educational websites and how their layout allows for easy navigation. I made sure to also add finishing touches like CSS animations.
