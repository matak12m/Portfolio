   For our final project for First Year, we had to make a game as a group of 4. Out of a few ideas, our lecturer picked a fishing game for us to make. We divided ourselves into 2 programmers and 2 asset artists, and since we were learning pixelart at the time, we decided on a pixelart design.

     I was in charge of making the shop, for which i made this Flash game-like design. I also made all the menu elements. <br>
      We ran out of time to finish the game, however, the assets were mostly complete. <br>
       Here are some of the assets I made! </section> <section class = "textExpanded">
