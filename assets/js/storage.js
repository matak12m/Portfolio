I came forward with an idea for a puzzle platformer, where you play as a clown in a circus world.

let ErooticaHTML = ' <a><img id = "img1" src = "assets/img/Erootica.png"> </a> <section class = "textExpanded">For Global Game Jam 2023, the theme was: "Growth". Naturally, I joined a team of students to make a Flower Dating Simulator. <br> The game combined elements of farming and typical visual novel dialogue, where you play as a gardener taking care of sentient flowers. Our team leader advocated for us to use Godot to develop the game, which was a challenge for us. <br></section><section class = "textExpanded"> My role on the team was the writer. We needed a lot of dialogue for the game, so I wrote about 6000 words of dialogue over 2 days, for 4 flowers with different personalities.  <br>I dipped my toes into Godot as well, but my main focus was on the writing.<br>You can play the game <a href ="https://michael-r-ryan.itch.io/erootica-enhanced"> here! </a> </section> <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/erootica_screenshot.png"> '
let HookedHTML = '<a><img id = "img1" src = "assets/img/shopWithItems.png"> </a> <section class = "textExpanded"> For our final project for First Year, we had to make a game as a group of 4. Out of a few ideas, our lecturer picked a fishing game for us to make. We divided ourselves into 2 programmers and 2 asset artists, and since we were learning pixelart at the time, we decided on a pixelart design. <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/canofworms.png"> <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/trashnet.png"> <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/coupon.png"> </section> <section class = "textExpanded"> I was in charge of making the shop, for which i made this Flash game-like design. I also made all the menu elements. <br> We ran out of time to finish the game, however, the assets were mostly complete. <br> Here are some of the assets I made!  <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/fishlure.png"> <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/reel.png"> <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/fishguide.png" </section>'
