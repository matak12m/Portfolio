One of our projects for UI Protoyping Module, we created an app we would like to use ourselves. I devised a To-Do app which helps you slot your thoughts into your schedule. <br>
 The idea is simple - everything starts out as a thought, which is nebulous and undefined. But once you add some parameters, like a deadline or a timeslot, they become part of your tasklist or calendar <br>

 Our goal was to create both a visual wireframe for the app, as well as a set of detailed instructions for a developer who would be making the app. <br>
We used Figma and Penpot for oour designs. Click <a href = "https://github.com/matak12m/To-Do-App"><button class = "textButton" > Here </button></a> to see all the assets and document with feature requirements, or scroll down for the layout designs.
