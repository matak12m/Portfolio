    This is the very first game I made, in my first year of college. A simple premise - copy answers from your classmate while the teacher is looking the other way, try to finish the test before the time runs out. if you get caught by the teacher, you lose! <br>
     This was inspired by many flash games that work on the same premise. The game is definitely a bit rough around the edges, but it still holds a special place in my heart.

   <section class = "textExpanded"> This was mainly a programming project, but I also made my own assets - although they are very basic, they still work well enough for the game. <br>
      The animations of the player (triangle head) would follow your cursor, which had to be hovering above the classmates desk to copy answers. <br>
